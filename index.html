      We would like to take a moment to thank everyone once again for their support of the 2018 GABMC in Richmond.  We had over 340 competitors representing 39 states (including Alaska!), 3 Canadian provinces, the U.K., Germany, and Japan, and raised an astounding $25,220 for The Humane Society of the United States & the Pink Ink Fund, a record for any single-day facial hair competition anywhere!
